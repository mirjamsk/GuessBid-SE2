                        Inverse auctio also known as lowest unique bid auction, is a type of strategy game
                        related to traditional auction. With one difference, the winner is the individual
                        with the lowest unique bid.

                        At this point the application does not provide an interface to deposit money and therefore update your credit.
                        Users can transfer money via a regular bank transaction to
                        our company's account. After the money has been received, the system
                        administrators will update user's credit accordingly</p>

                        Sellers cannot edit details of an auction once it has been created. This is to protect the bidders of an auction.

                        It should not be the case that they place a bid on one thing and then win the auction for a variant, or worse, completely different thing).
                        Sellers can however delete the auction should they need to.

                        GuessBid does not provide or organize the shipment or any other kind of item exchange. After an auction is finished,

                        are expected to come to mutually satisfying agreement and handle the exchange privately and fairly.

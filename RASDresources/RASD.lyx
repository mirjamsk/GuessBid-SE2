Introduction

\begin_layout Section
Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive description of
 the GuessBid system.
 It's aim is to communicate what the software should do and identify the
 capabilities and characteristics of the system being developed.
 This document is meant for everyone included in the production of the software.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Scope-of-app"

\end_inset

The aim of this project is to develop and implement GuessBid, an inverse
 auction system which works like a regular auction, only difference being
 the way the winner is determined.
 The winning bid in an inverse auction is the lowest unique bid, as opposed
 to being the highest one.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The developed system should allow new users to register.
 Users, once logged in, should be able to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Read the FAQ (Frequently asked questions)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Check his/her virtual credit balance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Create an auction for any good he/she has, defining an expiration date after
 which the auction finishes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Inquire the system about the current status of created and participating
 auctions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Browse/Search on-going auctions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Bid on an existing auction, with the exception of the auctions the users
 themselves created
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Receive and read notifications about his/her rankings and outcomes of auctions
 user has created or participated in
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each newly created auction should have a name, short description, end time
 and the optional picture.
 Once created, auction details should be immutable.
 This is a design choice made to protect users who have already placed a
 bid and thus spent credit on an item which they may have no interest in
 should the details change.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whenever a new bid is placed on an auction, the system should update user
 rankings in regards to the auction in question and send notifications to
 all participating users in case their rank changed.

\begin_layout Chapter
Overall description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Product perspective
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GuessBid is a web application that provides users a service described in
 section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Scope-of-app"

\end_inset

.
 The software will be developed using a server-client model.
 The server side contains the application's logic and is used to interact
 with permanent storage, serve pages to the client and process user input.
 The web client consists of dynamic web pages which provide an easy-to-use
 graphical interface and the web browser through which they are accessed.
 Considering GuessBid is a web app, it is platform independent.
 The only requirement is users having a web browser installed on a device
 of their choice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Identifying stakeholders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are tree distinct interest groups of people regarding this project:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Professors who have assigned the project and who expect it to be developed
 in a way which satisfies the given requirements while respecting the given
 deadlines.
 Their interests go beyond just working software, they are interested in
 conveying an thorough understanding of the underlying development process
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Users who will use the application for buying and selling their goods using
 the inverse auction paradigm 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Developer

group, in this case one person, responsible for the actual design and developmen
t of the software 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
User Characteristics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GuessBid is expected to have users across a wide range of demographics,
 meaning users of any age, gender and educational background.
 Still, given of the ubiquitous nature of internet and social media, it
 is assumed that people using our software do have the basic web browsing
 skills.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Actors identifying
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:def-actors"

\end_inset

Two possible actors interacting with our system are the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Guest person accessing a system that has either never registered of hasn't
 logged in yet.
 Guest can only access the initial page from where he has only two available
 options, to log in or to sign up for the first time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
User a person already registered and logged into the system.
 User can use all of the features offered by the application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Goals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:goals"

\end_inset

Having possible users in mind, GuessBid should have these features: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
registering new users
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
managing user's virtual money balance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
managing bids and user rankings for all auctions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 of its participants and the creator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Domain properties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

It is supposed that these conditions hold in the analyzed world: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the seller has the goods he is putting up for auction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the details of the goods provided by the seller are accurate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Assumptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering that there were some ambiguities in the specification document,
 the following facts are assumed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
users register with their email and password
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
users can change their email and password
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
there is an FAQ section to provide both, the explanation of the logic behind
 the concept of inverse auction and to provide the reasons behind some more
 restricting parts of users functionality (like not being able to change
 details of an active auction)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
after winning an auction, system automatically withdraws the amount of virtual
 money (as stated in the winning bet) from the winning user's account and
 deposits it into the sellers account

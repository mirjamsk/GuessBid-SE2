\begin_layout Section
Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive description of
 the GuessBid system.
 It's aim is to communicate what the software should do and identify the
 capabilities and characteristics of the system being developed.
 This document is meant for everyone included in the production of the software.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Scope-of-app"

\end_inset

The aim of this project is to develop and implement GuessBid, an inverse
 auction system which works like a regular auction, only difference being
 the way the winner is determined.
 The winning bid in an inverse auction is the lowest unique bid, as opposed
 to being the highest one.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The developed system should allow new users to register.
 Users, once logged in, should be able to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Read the FAQ (Frequently asked questions)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Check his/her virtual credit balance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Create an auction for any good he/she has, defining an expiration date after
 which the auction finishes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Inquire the system about the current status of created and participating
 auctions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Browse/Search on-going auctions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Bid on an existing auction, with the exception of the auctions the users
 themselves created
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Receive and read notifications about his/her rankings and outcomes of auctions
 user has created or participated in
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each newly created auction should have a name, short description, end time
 and the optional picture.
 Once created, auction details should be immutable.
 This is a design choice made to protect users who have already placed a
 bid and thus spent credit on an item which they may have no interest in
 should the details change.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whenever a new bid is placed on an auction, the system should update user
 rankings in regards to the auction in question and send notifications to
 all participating users in case their rank changed.

Overall description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Product perspective
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GuessBid is a web application that provides users a service described in
 section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Scope-of-app"

\end_inset

.
 The software will be developed using a server-client model.
 The server side contains the application's logic and is used to interact
 with permanent storage, serve pages to the client and process user input.
 The web client consists of dynamic web pages which provide an easy-to-use
 graphical interface and the web browser through which they are accessed.
 Considering GuessBid is a web application, it is platform independent.
 The only requirement is users having a web browser installed on a device
 of their choice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Identifying stakeholders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are tree distinct interest groups of people regarding this project:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Professors who have assigned the project and who expect it to be developed
 in a way which satisfies the given requirements while respecting the given
 deadlines.
 Their interests go beyond just working software, they are interested in
 conveying an thorough understanding of the underlying development process
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Users who will use the application for buying and selling their goods using
 the inverse auction paradigm 
\end_layout

t of the software 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
User Characteristics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GuessBid is expected to have users across a wide range of demographics,
 meaning users of any age, gender and educational background.
 Still, given of the ubiquitous nature of internet and social media, it
 is assumed that people using our software do have the basic web browsing
 skills.

User registration

\begin_layout Standard
Jolene is a university student looking to graduate in month's time.
 She just found out she had gotten her dream job and is starting right after
 graduation date.
 After the initial emotional response, she started planning the details
 of her move out of the college dorm.
 Looking around she realized she had accumulated a lot of things over the
 past 5 years.
 Things that aren't practical to take with her ( like her futon ), things
 she won't be needing anymore ( like her collection of colorful pencil cases
 ) and even things she never needed (one sombrero is fine, but three is
 pushing it).
 The way she sees it is, she has three options.
 First one, throw it all away.
 Second, organize a yard sale and third, put it all up for an online auction.
 After careful consideration she decided not to go with the first option
 because after acing her environmental studies test last semester, it wouldn't
 feel right to just throw it all away.
 The yard sale just seemed too much work, so she was left with the online
 auction option.
 She decided to go with the GuessBid platform because she heard it was popular
 among the students at her university.
 Given she didn't not have an account, she navigated for the first time
 to the GuessBid's web site and was shown a 
\emph on
Log in
\emph default
 and a 
\emph on
Sign up
\emph default
 form.
 She inputs her chosen username, her email address and password in the form
 and clicks the 
\emph on
Sign up
\emph default
 button.
 System verifies the input information is valid and she is redirected to
 Guess Bid's home page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Auction creation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the GuessBid's home page Jolene sees a personalized toolbar with the
 
\emph on

 She clicks it and is shown a form containing input fields for 
\emph on

\emph on

\emph default

\emph on
Category

\emph on

\emph default
, and an optional 
\emph on

\emph default
upload.
 She first decides to tackle the sombrero situation.
 In the 
\emph on

\emph default
 input field she types 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sombrero
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in the 
\emph on

 from the dropdown menu.
 As for

\emph default
 she picks the day after tomorrow using the DayPicker tool.
 Lastly, she quickly snaps a photo of the three colorful wide-brimmed hats,
 uploads it and presses the 
\emph on

 button.
 She is then redirected to the newly generated page showing her now active
 auction.

Luca was just invited to a theme party and him being wholly devoted to his
 fraternity, ingeniously  named Kappa-Tau, knows missing a party is not
 an option.
 The theme? Mariachi, of course.
 Given he has nothing to wear, he turns to GuessBid.
 He fires up his browser and navigates to GuessBid's website.
 After correctly logging in, he is redirected to the site's homepage containing
 a search box.
 He inputs 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sombrero
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the search box and is returned all active auctions containing the word
 sombrero either in its 
\emph on

\emph default
 or 
\emph on

.
 After skimming through his options he decides to bid on Jolene's auction,
 because three sombreros are apparently better than one.
 By clicking on Jolene's listing, Luca is redirected to that auction's page
 containing all the details and an input box to place his bid.
 He inputs 2.11â¬ and clicks on the 
\emph on

\emph default
 button.
 The system automatically withdraws 2 credit from his account and generates
 a notification with his current ranking.

Winning an auction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After two days, the auction automatically closes with Lucas's 2.11 credits
 being the winning bid.
 The system automatically withdraws 2.11credits from Luca's account and deposits
 them in Jolene's account.
 Luca and Jolene both get a notification regarding the closed auction and
 its winner, along with each others email addresses so the can make arrangements
 on how to handle the exchange of goods in question.
 After emailing each other, they were both pleased to learn they attend
 the same college so the exchange of goods turned out to be a breeze.

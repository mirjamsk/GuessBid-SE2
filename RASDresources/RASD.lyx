\begin_layout Chapter
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive description of
 the GuessBid system.
 It's aim is to communicate what the software should do and identify the
 capabilities and characteristics of the system being developed.
 This document is meant for everyone included in the production of the software.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aim of this project is to develop and implement GuessBid, an inverse
 auction system which works like a regular auction, only difference being
 the way the winner is determined.
 The winning bid in an inverse auction is the lowest unique bid, as opposed
 to being the highest one.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The developed system should allow new users to register.
 Users, once logged in, should be able to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Read the FAQ (Frequently asked questions)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Check his/her virtual credit balance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Create an auction for any good he/she has, defining an expiration date after
 which the auction finishes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Inquire the system about the current status of created and participating
 auctions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Browse/Search on-going auctions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Bid on an existing auction, with the exception of the auctions the users
 themselves created
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Receive and read notifications about his/her rankings and outcomes of auctions
 user has created or participated in
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each newly created auction should have a name, short description, end time
 and the optional picture.
 Once created, auction details should be immutable.
 This is a design choice made to protect users who have already placed a
 bid and thus spent credit on an item which they may have no interest in
 should the details change.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whenever a new bid is placed on an auction, the system should update user
 rankings in regards to the auction in question and send notifications to
 all participating users in case their rank changed.
